# Design of Bandgap Reference (BGR)
- Cadence GPDK 90 nm technology is used and designed in Cadence Virtuoso.
- Cascode current mirror is used to obtain nearly the same voltage on either side. 
- BGR has a PTAT slope of 1.696381mV / 째C and a CTAT slope of 1.696375mV / 째C.
- The reference output voltage of BGR is 1.164V at 2.5 VDD with a concave down curvature in w.r.t temperature (-40 째C to 120 째C).
- The slope of the Reference output voltage of BGR w.r.t Supply voltage VDD is 7.37mV / V.
